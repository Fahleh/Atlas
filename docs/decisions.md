# Architectural Decisions

This document explains *why* certain choices were made where the reasoning
isn't obvious from the code alone — not a changelog, and not a tutorial.
Update it when a deliberate decision is made that a future reader (including
a reviewer or interviewer) might otherwise mistake for an oversight or
inconsistency.

## `EntityModal`/`TaskModal` compound vs. `ProjectModal` single-block

**Decision:** `TaskModal` is a compound component (`.Header`, `.Title`,
`.CloseButton`, `.Body`, `.Field`, `.Footer`, `.FooterActions`,
`.CancelButton`, `.SubmitButton`, composed via `Object.assign`).
`ProjectModal` is not — it's a single component taking fixed props
(`name`, `description`, `dueDate`, `status`, `editingProject`), with no
caller-driven composition at all.

**Why they're different on purpose:**

The compound pattern (the lineage this codebase draws from — Radix,
Reach UI, shadcn) exists to solve one specific problem: *unknown, variable
composition*, where a consumer might need to nest arbitrary content inside
a shared shell in ways the component author can't fully predict up front.

`TaskModal` is compound because it predates the later `EntityModal`
extraction — its existing call site in `ProjectSlideOver.tsx` already used
the compound shape, and preserving that public API meant the refactor
(extracting the generic shell into `EntityModal`) didn't require touching
already-working, already-tested consumer code. It is **not** compound
because task editing genuinely requires that flexibility.

`ProjectModal` was built after `EntityModal` already existed, with no
equivalent legacy shape to preserve. Its fields are fixed and no caller
needs to compose it differently — applying the compound pattern here anyway
would mean reaching for machinery designed to solve a problem that doesn't
exist in this case. That would demonstrate not understanding *why* the
compound pattern exists, not consistency for its own sake.

**Takeaway for future modals:** default to a single-block component. Only
reach for the compound pattern when a component genuinely needs
caller-driven, variable composition — not because a similar-looking
component elsewhere happens to be compound.

## Status field availability at creation time (`CreateTaskInput`/`CreateProjectInput` vs. the live forms)

**Decision:** `lib/entityFactory.ts`'s `createTask`/`createProject`
functions deliberately exclude `status` from their input types — the
factory always defaults to `todo`/`active`, with status never settable at
call time. `TaskModal.StatusField` and `ProjectModal`'s status field, by
contrast, **do** let a user pick a status at creation time (still defaulting
to `todo`/`active`, but overridable before submit).

**Why these aren't in conflict, even though they look like it:**

These are two independent, separately-decided things that happen to share
a similar shape (task/project creation) but serve different purposes.

`entityFactory.ts` was built early, before real Supabase-backed forms
existed — it's a local/offline entity-construction utility (still used only
by its own test suite; not called anywhere in the live app's data flow as
of this writing). Its no-status-at-creation rule was a deliberate
simplification for that context.

The live `TaskModal`/`ProjectModal` forms were designed later, independently,
against what a real user of a project-management tool would actually expect
— and letting someone set a task's status at creation time (e.g. logging a
task that's already in progress) is standard, expected behavior in every
comparable tool.

**Takeaway:** don't treat `entityFactory.ts`'s input-type constraint as a
rule the live forms are violating. If these are ever intentionally unified
(e.g. by retiring `entityFactory.ts` or extending its input types), that's
a deliberate product decision to make explicitly — not a discovered bug to
silently "fix" by removing the status field from either surface.
